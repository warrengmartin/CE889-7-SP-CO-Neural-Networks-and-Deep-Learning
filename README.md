 Abstract:
 
This report investigates how feature engineering impacts the performance of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Logistical Regression models for processing EEG data. Each of the models were put through two sets of training sessions; one with raw EEG data and the other using time-domain features (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) and connectivity features(mean upper triangle correlation). Each of the sessions shed light on the significants of feature engineering with Logistic Regression, CNN, and LSTM models, resulting in a lower validation and training loss, higher precision accuracy, and stopping earlier in the training process due to quicker learning. While feature selection did not help the Logistic model preform better much better, the feature selection and implementation process suggests that feature engineering can significantly improve the performance of all models.
